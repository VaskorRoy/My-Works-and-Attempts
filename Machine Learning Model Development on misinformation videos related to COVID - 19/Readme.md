This folder contains a machine learning model I tried to create through Orange Data Mining Ver. 3.30.2 on the misinformational videos circulated in the internet related to the COVID - 19 
pandemic. My intention was to create a model which predicts if a video uploaded on youtube circulates misinformation about the pandemic based on certain keywords on its title,
the view count and the channel subscriber count. 
The folder contains the following files - 
1. The report itself
2. The dataset used to create the model
3. The orange file representing the model building workflow
